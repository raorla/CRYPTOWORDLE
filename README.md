# CryptoWordle

**A Wordle nobody can cheat — not even us.**

The secret five-letter word lives on ETH Sepolia as five encrypted handles inside [iExec Nox](https://docs.iex.ec/), a TEE-based confidential compute layer (Intel TDX — not FHE). While a round is open, the *only* principal with access to those handles is the game contract itself. Not the server that created the round. Not the people who wrote this code. Not the players. Nobody on Earth can read the word — yet every guess gets its green/yellow/grey hints computed **on ciphertext**, and when someone wins, the pot pays out **trustlessly**, settled by a KMS decryption proof verified on-chain.

When the round ends, the word is revealed publicly so anyone can check that every hint handed out was honest. Provable fairness, end to end.

- 10/10 integration tests passing against the **real** local Nox stack (KMS + gateway + TDX runner in Docker) — no mocks anywhere.
- Trustless claims: anyone can crank `claim()`; the pot always pays the player who made the winning guess.
- Un-leakability is *asserted in tests*, not just promised: the ACL of every secret-letter handle is checked on the NoxCompute contract.

## How the privacy guarantee works

Follow the word on its journey:

1. **Pick.** The round generator draws a word with a CSPRNG (`node:crypto.randomInt`) from 1,500 curated answers (Knuth's Stanford GraphBase five-letter list, public domain). It never logs it, never writes it to disk.
2. **Seal.** Each letter (encoded 0–25) is encrypted via `encryptInput` over attested TLS to the Nox handle gateway (itself a TEE). What comes back is five opaque 32-byte **handles** plus input proofs. The plaintext variable goes out of scope. Gone.
3. **Lock.** `createRound` validates the proofs on-chain and grants access with `Nox.allowThis` **only** — the contract is the sole principal on the ACL. No viewer, no admin, no public decryption. You can audit this yourself: `getSecretHandles(roundId)` returns the handles, and `isPubliclyDecryptable` / `isAllowed` / `isViewer` on the NoxCompute contract must all say *no* for everyone except the game contract. Our test suite asserts exactly that.
4. **Play.** Guesses are public letters in calldata (you typed them; they were never secret). For each guess the contract emits ~95 encrypted operations (`eq`/`select`/`add`/`gt`) that the Nox runner executes on plaintext **inside an Intel TDX enclave**. Per-letter colors (0 grey, 1 yellow, 2 green) and a win flag are the only values marked publicly decryptable. A row sums to 10 if and only if all five letters are green (the best a non-winning row can do is 9), so `colorSum == 10 ⇔ win`.
5. **Settle.** The winner's win-flag handle is decrypted by the KMS, which returns a `decryptionProof`. `claim(roundId, guessIndex, proof)` verifies that proof **on-chain** via `Nox.publicDecrypt` — forged proofs revert, genuine proofs of a false value revert, and a valid proof pays the pot to the *guesser*, never the caller. Anyone can crank it.
6. **Reveal.** After the round is Solved (or Expired), the secret letters are migrated to fresh handles (`add(secret, 0)`) and made publicly decryptable. Anyone can now decrypt the answer and replay every hint against it.

### Threat model, honestly

One process sees the word in plaintext: the round generator, for the milliseconds between the CSPRNG pick and `encryptInput`. It then discards it — nothing is logged or persisted. You do not have to trust that claim blindly: the post-round reveal lets anyone verify, after the fact, that the sealed word matched every hint that was handed out during the round. A round generator that lied — or kept the word and played it — would produce hints inconsistent with the revealed answer, publicly and permanently. Inside the round's lifetime, the on-chain ACL guarantees nobody (including us) can decrypt the secret.

The remaining trust assumptions are Nox's own: Intel TDX attestation, and the Nox KMS/gateway operated by iExec (single-node KMS today, per their docs).

## Quick start

Prerequisites: **Node.js 22+**, **Docker** (for the local confidential stack), npm.

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd CryptoWordle
npm install
```

### 1. Run the full confidential test suite locally

The `@iexec-nox/nox-hardhat-plugin` boots the entire Nox off-chain stack (KMS, handle gateway, TDX runner, NATS, MinIO) in Docker, deploys NoxCompute on a local node, and runs the tests end-to-end against it — genuine encryption, genuine KMS proofs:

```bash
npm test          # 10 integration tests; first run pulls Docker images (slow)
```

A single guess emits ~95 TEE ops executed sequentially by the local runner, so the suite takes several minutes. On failure, stack logs land in `offchain-services.log`.

Faster tiers that need neither Docker nor a chain:

```bash
npm run test:unit                 # word-list integrity + letter codec (node --test)
cd frontend && npm test           # store / DOM renderer / modals (Vitest + jsdom)
cd frontend && npm run test:e2e   # UI-shell smoke (Playwright; one-time: npx playwright install chromium)
```

### 2. Deploy to ETH Sepolia

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # set SEPOLIA_RPC_URL and DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY (fresh dev key, Sepolia ETH funded)
npm run compile
npm run deploy:sepolia     # writes deployments/sepolia.json
npm run export-abi         # regenerates shared/abi.ts for the frontend
npm run sanity:sepolia     # optional: full create→guess→decrypt→claim→reveal probe on the real testnet
```

### 3. Run the round generator

```bash
npm run round:create   # create one round (if none open) and exit
npm run round:daemon   # keep a round always open, crank claims for winners, expire stale rounds
```

Pot size and duration are set via `ROUND_POT_ETH` and `ROUND_DURATION_SECONDS` in `.env`.

### 4. Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev            # Vite dev server; connect MetaMask on Sepolia
```

## How to play

1. Connect MetaMask (ETH Sepolia) and open the current round — you'll see the pot and the sealed-word badge.
2. Type a five-letter word and submit. Your guess is a public transaction; the transaction sets an explicit gas limit because wallets cannot estimate Nox calls (see note below).
3. Wait a few seconds to a couple of minutes: the TEE computes your hints on ciphertext, then the KMS makes the five colors (and the win flag) decryptable. The UI polls and paints the row.
4. You get **six guesses per wallet per round**. Guess the word — all five green — and the round-generator daemon (or anyone, including you) submits `claim` with the KMS proof. The pot pays your wallet directly.
5. If nobody wins before the deadline (+15-minute claim grace period), the round expires, the pot refunds the creator, and the word is revealed either way — check that the hints were honest.

### A note on gas

Wallets and RPCs cannot estimate gas for transactions that touch the Nox precompile — MetaMask defaults to roughly the block gas limit, which public RPCs reject. Every Nox-touching write in this repo sets explicit gas, based on measurements from the local coprocessor (`test/integration/gas-probe.test.ts`):

| Function        | Measured gas | Budget set (≈2× padded) |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| `createRound`   | 416k         | 900k                    |
| `guess`         | 1.82M (~17k per Nox op) | 4.0M         |
| `claim`         | 539k         | 1.2M                    |
| `revealExpired` | 518k         | 1.2M                    |

## The duplicate-letter simplification

Classic Wordle colors duplicate letters with a per-letter budget: if the secret has one `b` and you guess two, only one shows yellow. Nox has no encrypted OR or per-position bookkeeping primitives, so "present anywhere" is a counting argument on ciphertext: `cnt_i = Σ_j (guess_i == secret_j)`, present ⇔ `cnt > 0`. Consequence: **every** duplicate guess letter shows yellow if the letter appears anywhere in the secret (e.g. `kebab` vs `abbey` → ⬜🟨🟩🟨🟨, where classic Wordle would grey the final `b`). This is a documented trade-off that keeps the op count — and gas — bounded, and it never affects the win condition (all-green is exact). The behaviour is pinned by a dedicated duplicate-letter test.
